/**
 * League registry.
 *
 * `sport` + `slug` map to ESPN's public site API:
 *   https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{sport}/{slug}/scoreboard
 *   https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{sport}/{slug}/standings
 *
 * These are unauthenticated, unofficial endpoints ESPN serves for its own
 * site — no API key, but also no uptime guarantee or rate-limit SLA.
 * If a league ever 404s or changes shape, check the current slug at
 * https://gist.github.com/akeaswaran/b48b02f1c94f873c6655e7129910fc3b
 * (a widely-used community reference) and update the entry below.
 *
 * `hasOdds`: whether this league's scoreboard typically carries an
 * `odds` block (spread/over-under) in the ESPN feed. Set false to skip
 * rendering an odds row entirely rather than showing "no odds" noise.
 *
 * `logo`: a best-effort ESPN CDN league badge URL (the same CDN that
 * serves team logos embedded in the scoreboard feed). These aren't
 * returned by the API itself, so the exact filename can drift — every
 * <img> that uses this in the app has an onerror handler that just
 * hides the badge rather than showing a broken-image icon, so a stale
 * URL degrades gracefully instead of looking broken.
